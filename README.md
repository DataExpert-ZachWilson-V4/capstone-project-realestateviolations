# Overview
Housing authorities in large cities track violations related to health, safety, and other concerns. However, due to a fragmented landscape with diverse stakeholders, communication gaps often occur. These gaps lead to delays that harm tenants by not addressing their issues promptly and hurt owners who unknowingly accrue fines from unaddressed violations. Our goal is to solve this by enabling anyone to subscribe for updates on specific properties, enhancing information flow, and making public data sets more accessible and user-friendly.

## Datasets used
We decided to start small with the largest housing authority in the United States. New York City, NY.
The city of New York provides access to public datasets containing violation information.
We aim to collate this data in a presentable way that makes it easy to notify owner-operators of violations, and for future tenants to make informed renting decisions based on where high numbers of violations have not been addressed.
